# 2D Color Puzzle
A project with OpenGL in C that is
a 2D color puzzle in which the user
makes moves to try to sort the colors
together to make a smooth gradient.

## Puzzle Solving
When the program launches a sorted gradient is displayed and the user can press enter to scramble the grid.
The user clicks on a starting tile and can use the wasd to move rows or columns of tiles. The objective is to sort the grid into
a smooth gradient using the outside edges of the grid as a guide to where pieces should be placed. When the correct grid is found
a win statement is printed in the console with the amount of moves it took to solve the puzzle.
